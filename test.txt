 If you're in the fantasy football playoffs, it's a good bet you're spending today obsessing over your lineups, thinking about the second-line stats like targets and touches.
Regardless of sport? When it comes to fantasy? Possession is king. It's especially true for fantasy basketball managers. Whether you're in a roto league, points league or playing DFS, it's wholly beneficial to get into the habit of tracking possession.
In fantasy hoops, we have myriad ways to quantify possession. The classic method revolves around usage rate. Usage rate is an incisive metric that estimates the percentage of possessions a player can claim as his whenever said player is on the floor.
But as the marriage between advanced analytics and hoops deepens, we're confronted with an ever-growing list of ways to pinpoint the impact of any given touch. Because it's not just about having the ball in your hands. It's about how long you hang onto the ball, where your possession occurs, and what you do with the ball once you have it.
As I write this, I'm watching the third quarter of the Sixers-Raptors tilt. It's a game featuring several of the NBA's greatest possession players.
That's right ... JJ Redick.
Did you know that Redick is a top-five points-per-touch producer? Redick generates 0.436 points every time the ball hits his hands. It's one of the reasons he remains fantasy relevant despite averaging only 42.2 touches per game.
If you want to see elite possession rates, and how they're reflective of fantasy star status, check out Leonard. He's second in points per touch at 0.498, and top 20 in average seconds per touch at 4.69.

The latest buzz on trades, injuries and rotation moves as we look around the NBA to suss out key fantasy tidbits on every team.

Guess what? Trae Young is not as good as Stephen Curry. In fact, he may not even be as good as his backup on the Hawks. Here are some other backups to consider for your fantasy rosters.
If you ever want to undertake a deep-sea dive into the world of possession, take a virtual trip over to our friends at NBA.com. There's a page over there that depicts several ways to track touches and quality of each individual touch.
Their roster of touch-related stats is impressive. Touches per game. Time of possession. Average seconds per touch. Points per touch. Post touches. Elbow touches. Paint touches. How do we divine all of these marvelous metrics into something that's useful for fantasy?
I like to use these categories to get a bead on fantasy potential. When a young player is amongst the league's elite in touches, it means he's getting elite volume. Which means all he normally has to do to become a fantasy star ... is refine his efficiency.
One would assume point guards dominate touches per game. And while it's true point guards make their presence felt in this stat, you might be surprised to learn the league leaders in touches per game are (91.3) and (89.0).
When a post player is dominating possession like Griffin or Gasol, that tells us how important they are within their given team's offensive sets. The Pistons' offense flows through Griffin. The Grizzlies' plodding attack rambles through Gasol. That lets us know both of these big men are in line for a key out-of-position stat: assists.
Both Griffin and Gasol are amongst the NBA's best when it comes to pivot-generated assists. When you roster a big who averages more than four dimes a night, your imaginary team has a huge hidden advantage.
Let's talk about quality of a given touch. I think we could all agree that the longer a player hangs onto the ball, the greater the chance he'll generate a fantasy-worthy stat.
You could also probably guess that elite guards dominate seconds per touch. So, it's not a shocker to discover that leads the league in average seconds per touch. Or that is third.
But the names in second and fourth place might surprise you:
